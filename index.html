                    <div class="col-12"><p>Many people have had the privilege of participating in recreational sports. The small percentage of people who have not, have most likely considered participating, but their circumstances do not play in their favor. Many kids are under the circumstance where parents are not able to put their children into sports teams. Unfortunately, a big part of this has to do with financial restrictions. There may be loopholes to avoiding costs in sports, but not every child would have this privilege. In the United States, the development of kids within sports has become the second priority in many cases. Youth sports has disregarded the main purpose of sports in general and has instead become more of a business. A business where the most well known teams are the most expensive. Because of financial circumstances, many kids' talent will become unnoticed since they do not have a place to showcase it. Sports should not be centered around money since there are many more positives that outweigh negatives when considering them to be cost-free.</p></div>

                    <div class="col-12"><p>Fortunately, throughout most of my youth I participated in club soccer. The costs of joining these club teams would come with a price tag, which would be a burden to my parents and I. Not only would there be fees to join these sports teams, but traveling with the team would be additional costs that would come with joining. There were times where I was not able to travel with the team because the cost of hotels and transportation would be too expensive. Although the cost of joining these teams was not ideal, it allowed me to make great friendships and taught me many unique life lessons that I would not have been able to learn anywhere else.</p></div>

            <div class="col-12 shift"><p>Taking money out of the equation within youth sports would take the weight off of many parents' shoulders. Some families simply cannot afford to put their child into sports teams. There are two sides of the discussion when considering costs within sports. The child whose parents can afford the team, and the child whose parents cannot afford it. It might seem like a luxury to the child whose parents cannot finance the team. This luxury comes with many unforgettable experiences which many kids undervalue. These experiences develop higher self-esteem, better social skills, fewer depressive symptoms, and higher confidence. There have been instances where highschools have switched to charging a fee for sports. In many of these instances the number of students participating decreased. An interviewer who interviewed different athletic directors shared that  “One participant from a higher poverty district explained that sports programs are essential for keeping at-risk students out of trouble and involvement positively impacts school attendance.”(Eyler) To many kids sports is the only time they get to be with friends and get to enjoy themselves. Sports play a very big role in the physical health and mental health of a person.</p></div>

                <div class="col-12 shift"><p>The increase in the amount of students who would be active if sports were to be free would help combat obesity in the US. The time students would spend behind their phones or watching tv could be translated into socializing with friends and participating in physical activity. To many atheletes, sports is an outlet that allows them to forget about all the noise that revolves around them. Now imagine if the students' parents could no longer afford to join the cost of participating. There would no longer be a outlet for the athelete, and would cause them to search elsewhere for another. We talk about feeling good, but we not only need to feel good physically but also mentally. Mental health is already a topic that is hard to discuss, but sports are on a child's mental health. Sports allow us to express emotions and have something to relieve any negative emotions in a safe way. There is a high chance that when looking for other alternatives people may run into negative actions like the use of drugs and alcohol, which would lead to far worse outcomes in the future.</p></div>

            <div class="col-12 shift"><p>There are always two sides to an argument, and there are many reasons as to why sports within the US would not be able to be free. One instance would be that funding teams or maintaining them would be very hard to manage without good financial support. Without money it would be difficult to find coaching staff or rent fields for practice. If teams are low on budget the alternative for them would probably be to find a trainer who volunteers. Unfortunately there would not be enough trainers who would want to volunteer that would satisfy the demand that would be increased if sports were free. Participants may not be motivated or committed to the team if there is not a financial commitment from them. This could have a bad effect on a team's success. Because participants might not feel as invested in the sport or the team, this lack of dedication could also lead to higher dropout rates. In some cases, responsibility plays a very big role in developing the character of a person. An article which discusses the systematic finances within sports states that, “The structure of the pathway, or the 'system', is crucial in facilitating the optimum chances of success for talented athletes to reach their potential.(Morley) Financial pressure can be a good thing since there is a call to action for the athlete. Also, without a financial commitment from participants, there might not be enough equipment. The performance of the team as a whole as well as the growth of athletes may be negatively impacted by the lack of resources.</p></div>

            <div class="col-12 shift"><h4>Where would teams find the money to be funded?</h4></div>
            <div class="col-12 shift"><p>Although, there may be obstacles that encounter the capability of sports being free for all participants it does not mean that it cannot be overcome. Funding would be an issue, but finding sponsorships would be a great alternative to cover all of the costs that come with maintaining a team. Also, if the correct environment is set for the athletes it could be very beneficial since it would lead to the development of new competition. With this competition being instilled and more people participating, new talent would be discovered. In England for example many soccer teams are free for anyone. The team may be free, but since there are limited roster spots on these teams it makes the competition ten times more competitive. And for this reason, England is the mecca of soccer and produces some of the best athletes in the world. </p></div>

            <div class="col-12 shift"><p>In conclusion, there are many persuasive arguments on both ends of the question of whether or not sports should be free for all participants. While the cost may prevent some families from taking part, sports have many advantages, including bettering physical and mental health, increasing socialization, and feeling of community. It's crucial to take into account the difficulties of funding and maintaining teams in the absence of participant money, though. Despite these difficulties, finding alternative funding sources and fostering competition can help to get past these barriers and give everyone the same chances. In the end, sports have a significant impact on young people's lives, and we should work to discover ways to increase that impact. </p></div>
